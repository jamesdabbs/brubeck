  p I actually haven't gotten all that many questions yet, so there's a good chance yours isn't on this list. If not, #{link_to 'email me', 'mailto:jamesdabbs+brubeck@gmail.com'} and I'll be glad to help.

p Sure. One of the #{link_to 'planned features', 'https://github.com/jamesdabbs/brubeck/issues'} is to include an API for getting what you want yourself, but until then, just #{link_to 'shoot me an email', 'mailto:jamesdabbs+brubeck@gmail.com'} telling me what you need and what you're planning on using it for.
