h3 For Researchers
p Suppose you are interested in a property #{link_to 'P', property_path(61)} and have shown that #{link_to 'Perfectly Normal', property_path(15)} ‚áí P, #{link_to 'CCC', property_path(29)} ‚áí P, and P ‚áí #{link_to 'Completely Regular', property_path(12)}. Here, you simply #{link_to 'add', theorem_path(127)} #{link_to 'those', theorem_path(128)} #{link_to 'theorems', theorem_path(126)}, let the site deduce what it can about the #{link_to 'spaces', spaces_path} it knows, and then #{link_to 'search', search_path} for spaces where P is still indeterminate. This streamlines time-consuming literature study and allows researchers to benefit from pooling their knowledge of exotic examples.

h3 For Students
p Every piece of information in the database should be traceable back to first principles, so students can #{link_to 'search for an interesting example', search_path(q: 'First Countable + Separable + ~Second Countable')} and then follow along with deriving its properties. Admittedly, there are currently #{link_to 'several traits missing proofs', unproven_path} - consider those your homework assignment.
