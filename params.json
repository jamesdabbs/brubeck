Feel free to submit those in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/brubeck/issues).\r\n\r\nIf you want to push up code, open up a pull request. I'll review it, merge it in, and push it live once it's good to go.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
